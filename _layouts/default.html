             Anesthesiology is a complex and fascinating science and practice.  There's pure science, 
            physiology and design.  I'm particularly interested in mundain, low-tech practice, design and policy issues that can
            reduce the likelihood of patients being harmed.  I'll explore that issue here.

            In the United States right now a very important social justice and environmental issue is housing.  In short,
            there's not enough of it built to meet demand.  Zoning policies that require individual homes, minimum lot sizes, limit
            the number of floors of multi-unit buildings all promote sprawl, destroy the environment and lead to greater 
            segregation and huge disparities of income and opportunity.  <a href="https://youtu.be/9yZhk2GCYww" target="_blank">Here's a link to a brief video</a> outlining the problem.  
            Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/2f2E0DM2ZSY" target="_blank">another link to a video</a> by the Newton Chamber of Commerce exploring how the lack of housing is strangling local businesses.

          <p>
            In addition to policies focused on housing there are other policies that will likely contribute to a more
            just and sustainable world.  Right now I'm thinking about Ranked Choice Voting, increasing investigation and 
            procecution into white-colar crime and requiring by law that candidates for major office release their tax returns.
